# Soybean Leaf Detection with CNN

**Description**
This repository is contains the code and resources for my thesis project, "Soybean Leaf Detection using Digital Image with Machine Learning Model Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)."

**Overview:**
- 🌿 **Objective:** The primary goal of this research is to develop a robust and accurate system for detecting soybean leaves within digital images. Accurate leaf detection is crucial for various agricultural applications, including crop monitoring, disease detection, and yield prediction.

- 📷 **Dataset:** This project used a comprehensive dataset of soybean leaf images sourced from datadryad, which includes various lighting conditions, backgrounds, and leaf orientations, to train and evaluate our CNN model. 

- 🤖 **Model:** This project implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification and fine-tuned it for leaf detection. The model leverages deep learning techniques to learn distinctive features from soybean leaf images.

- 📊 **Performance:** This project provides an in-depth analysis of the model's performance, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, to assess its effectiveness in soybean leaf detection.
